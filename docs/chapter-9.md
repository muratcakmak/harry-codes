# Chapter 9: The Forbidden If

## Avoiding Over-Nesting and Using Guards

Just as there are forbidden curses, there are some coding habits that, while not unforgivable, can lead to trouble. One such habit is over-nesting your `if` statements or getting lost in a tangle of conditions. In this chapter, we'll learn how to keep our conditions clean and understandable. We'll also introduce the concept of a guard clause, which is a neat way to handle special cases upfront and avoid deep nesting.

## üå≤ The Problem with Deep Nesting

Imagine this scenario: You have a function that allows a student to enter a restricted section of the library if they have a note from a teacher, and if the library is open, and if they are accompanied by a prefect. You might be tempted to write:

```js
let hasNote = true;
let libraryOpen = true;
let withPrefect = false;

if (hasNote) {
  if (libraryOpen) {
    if (withPrefect) {
      console.log("Access granted to the restricted section.");
    } else {
      console.log("You need a prefect to accompany you.");
    }
  } else {
    console.log("Library is closed. Come back later.");
  }
} else {
  console.log("You need a signed note from a teacher.");
}
```

This code works, but notice how the `if` statements are nested inside each other like a Russian doll or deep inside the Forbidden Forest. The more conditions you add, the more indented and complex it gets. This can become hard to read and maintain.

The output logic here is:

- If missing a note, immediately deny.
- If note is present but library closed, deny.
- If note and library open but no prefect, deny.
- If all conditions true, grant access.

It's often easier to understand such logic if we check for failure conditions early and handle them, then proceed to the success path. That's where guard clauses come in.

## üõ° Using Guard Clauses

A guard clause is like a bouncer at the door of a function or section of code. It checks for a specific condition and handles it (often by exiting the function early or returning), so that the rest of the code can assume that condition is not the issue.

Rewriting the above with guard clauses:

```js
function canAccessRestrictedSection(hasNote, libraryOpen, withPrefect) {
  if (!hasNote) {
    console.log("You need a signed note from a teacher.");
    return;
  }
  if (!libraryOpen) {
    console.log("Library is closed. Come back later.");
    return;
  }
  if (!withPrefect) {
    console.log("You need a prefect to accompany you.");
    return;
  }
  // If we've passed all the guards above, all conditions are met:
  console.log("Access granted to the restricted section.");
}

// Test the function
canAccessRestrictedSection(true, true, false);
```

Let's go through this:

- We define a function `canAccessRestrictedSection` with three parameters.
- The first `if` checks `!hasNote` (the `!` means NOT, so "if not hasNote" i.e., hasNote is false). If they don't have a note, we log the denial message and return. That `return` exits the function early, so none of the later code runs.
- Next, we check `!libraryOpen`. If the library isn't open, log message and return early.
- Next, `!withPrefect`. If no prefect, log and return.
- Only if all these conditions were false (meaning the student had a note, library was open, and they were with a prefect) will the code reach the final `console.log("Access granted...")`.

This structure avoids deep nesting. Each check is one level and returns immediately if the condition isn't met. The "happy path" (success case) is at the bottom with no `else` needed because any failure has already caused an exit.

This guard style often makes code easier to follow: we handle all the "bad" or special cases up front, and then the normal case flows naturally.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Combining Conditions to Avoid Nesting

Another scenario: sometimes you nest ifs like:

```js
if (conditionA) {
  if (conditionB) {
    // do something
  }
}
```

This can be flattened using an AND:

```js
if (conditionA && conditionB) {
  // do something
}
```

This does exactly the same check: both A and B must be true to get inside. This way, you reduce one level of nesting.

Similarly, if you had:

```js
if (!condA) {
  // handle A false case
} else {
  if (!condB) {
    // handle B false case
  } else {
    // both A and B are true here
    doSomething();
  }
}
```

This can be rearranged to guard style:

```js
if (!condA) {
  // handle A false
  return;
}
if (!condB) {
  // handle B false
  return;
}
// If we get here, condA and condB are true:
doSomething();
```

Or combine A and B:

```js
if (condA && condB) {
  doSomething();
} else if (!condA) {
  // handle A false
} else if (!condB) {
  // handle B false
}
```

There are multiple ways to logically restructure conditions; the key is to aim for clarity and avoid too many nested blocks if possible.

## üï∏ The "Else" Trap

Sometimes every `if` in a chain has an `else`, and that `else` contains another `if`, and so on. Too many else-if nesting can also get confusing. One trick:

- If the last `else` is just a default action, you can often handle it after the `if` chain rather than nesting everything inside one giant `else`.

For example:

```js
if (x < 0) {
  console.log("Negative");
} else {
  if (x === 0) {
    console.log("Zero");
  } else {
    console.log("Positive");
  }
}
```

This can be flattened:

```js
if (x < 0) {
  console.log("Negative");
} else if (x === 0) {
  console.log("Zero");
} else {
  console.log("Positive");
}
```

Which we already learned. But if you had something where after handling some cases you just do a default action, sometimes you don't even need an `else`, you can just do it after an early return or break from a loop.

## üìù Try It: Simplify the Forest

Try it yourself: The following code is a bit messy with nesting. Try to rewrite it in a cleaner way (maybe using guard clauses or combined conditions):

```js
let potionReady = true;
let haveCrystalPhial = false;
let professorApproved = false;

if (potionReady) {
  if (haveCrystalPhial) {
    if (professorApproved) {
      console.log("You bottle the potion successfully.‚úÖ");
    } else {
      console.log(
        "Professor needs to approve the potion before bottling.‚ùå"
      );
    }
  } else {
    console.log("You need a crystal phial to store the potion.‚ùå");
  }
} else {
  console.log("Potion is not ready yet. Keep brewing...‚è≥");
}
```

Consider what the checks are and how you might re-order them or use guard returns (if you put it inside a function) to make it clearer. There's no single "right" answer, but aim for less nesting.

## ‚ú® Key Takeaways

- Deeply nested `if` statements can make code hard to follow. Look for ways to simplify.
- Guard clauses check for error/edge conditions early and handle them, often with an early return, so you don't need `else` blocks wrapping the main logic.
- Combine conditions with `&&` or `||` where appropriate to reduce nested structure.
- Clean, readable code is easier to debug and less prone to logical mistakes ‚Äì in magic or coding, clarity helps prevent miscasting spells!

With these logical structuring tricks, you're less likely to get lost in complex conditions. Now that we've covered a lot of ground in control flow and looping, it's time for a mini project to practice these skills! Next up, we'll be building a Dueling Club Tracker where you'll apply arrays, loops, and conditionals together to keep track of some duels. Get your dueling robes on!
